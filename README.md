## noVNC: HTML VNC Client Library and Application

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/novnc/noVNC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/novnc/noVNC)

### Description

noVNC is both a HTML VNC client JavaScript library and an application built on
top of that library. noVNC runs well in any modern browser including mobile
browsers (iOS and Android).

Many companies, projects and products have integrated noVNC including
[OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org),
[OpenNebula](http://opennebula.org/),
[LibVNCServer](http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net), and
[ThinLinc](https://cendio.com/thinlinc). See
[the Projects and Companies wiki page](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/wiki/Projects-and-companies-using-noVNC)
for a more complete list with additional info and links.

### Browser Requirements

noVNC uses many modern web technologies so a formal requirement list is
not available. However these are the minimum versions we are currently
aware of:

* Chrome 49, Firefox 44, Safari 10, Opera 36, IE 11, Edge 12


### Server Requirements

noVNC follows the standard VNC protocol, but unlike other VNC clients it does
require WebSockets support. Many servers include support (e.g.
[x11vnc/libvncserver](http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/),
[QEMU](http://www.qemu.org/), and
[MobileVNC](http://www.smartlab.at/mobilevnc/)), but for the others you need to
use a WebSockets to TCP socket proxy. noVNC has a sister project
[websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify) that provides a simple such
proxy.


### Quick Start

* Use the launch script to automatically download and start websockify, which
  includes a mini-webserver and the WebSockets proxy. The `--vnc` option is
  used to specify the location of a running VNC server:

    `./utils/launch.sh --vnc localhost:5901`

* Point your browser to the cut-and-paste URL that is output by the launch
  script. Hit the Connect button, enter a password if the VNC server has one
  configured, and enjoy!


### Integration and Deployment
