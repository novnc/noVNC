### Description

noVNC is both a HTML VNC client JavaScript library and an application built on
top of that library. noVNC runs well in any modern browser including mobile
browsers (iOS and Android).

Many companies, projects and products have integrated noVNC including
[OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org),
[OpenNebula](http://opennebula.org/),
[LibVNCServer](http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net), and
[ThinLinc](https://cendio.com/thinlinc). See
[the Projects and Companies wiki page](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/wiki/Projects-and-companies-using-noVNC)
for a more complete list with additional info and links.

### Browser Requirements

noVNC uses many modern web technologies so a formal requirement list is
not available. However these are the minimum versions we are currently
aware of:

* Chrome 64, Firefox 79, Safari 13.4, Opera 51, Edge 79


### Server Requirements

noVNC follows the standard VNC protocol, but unlike other VNC clients it does
require WebSockets support. Many servers include support (e.g.
[x11vnc/libvncserver](http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/),
[QEMU](http://www.qemu.org/), and
[MobileVNC](http://www.smartlab.at/mobilevnc/)), but for the others you need to
use a WebSockets to TCP socket proxy. noVNC has a sister project
[websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify) that provides a simple such
proxy.


### Quick Start

* Use the `novnc_proxy` script to automatically download and start websockify, which
  includes a mini-webserver and the WebSockets proxy. The `--vnc` option is
  used to specify the location of a running VNC server:

    `./utils/novnc_proxy --vnc localhost:5901`
    
* If you don't need to expose the web server to public internet, you can
  bind to localhost:
  
    `./utils/novnc_proxy --vnc localhost:5901 --listen localhost:6081`

* Point your browser to the cut-and-paste URL that is output by the `novnc_proxy`
  script. Hit the Connect button, enter a password if the VNC server has one
  configured, and enjoy!

### Installation from Snap Package
Running the command below will install the latest release of noVNC from Snap:

`sudo snap install novnc`

#### Running noVNC from Snap Directly

You can run the Snap-package installed novnc directly with, for example:

`novnc --listen 6081 --vnc localhost:5901 # /snap/bin/novnc if /snap/bin is not in your PATH`

If you want to use certificate files, due to standard Snap confinement restrictions you need to have them in the /home/\<user\>/snap/novnc/current/ directory. If your username is jsmith an example command would be:
  
  `novnc --listen 8443 --cert ~jsmith/snap/novnc/current/self.crt --key ~jsmith/snap/novnc/current/self.key --vnc ubuntu.example.com:5901`

#### Running noVNC from Snap as a Service (Daemon)
The Snap package also has the capability to run a 'novnc' service which can be 
configured to listen on multiple ports connecting to multiple VNC servers 
(effectively a service runing multiple instances of novnc).
Instructions (with example values):

List current services (out-of-box this will be blank):

```
sudo snap get novnc services
Key             Value
services.n6080  {...}
services.n6081  {...}
```

Create a new service that listens on port 6082 and connects to the VNC server 
running on port 5902 on localhost:

`sudo snap set novnc services.n6082.listen=6082 services.n6082.vnc=localhost:5902`

(Any services you define with 'snap set' will be automatically started)
Note that the name of the service, 'n6082' in this example, can be anything 
as long as it doesn't start with a number or contain spaces/special characters.

View the configuration of the service just created:

```
sudo snap get novnc services.n6082
Key                    Value
services.n6082.listen  6082
services.n6082.vnc     localhost:5902
```

Disable a service (note that because of a limitation in  Snap it's currently not 
possible to unset config variables, setting them to blank values is the way 
to disable a service):

`sudo snap set novnc services.n6082.listen='' services.n6082.vnc=''`

(Any services you set to blank with 'snap set' like this will be automatically stopped)

Verify that the service is disabled (blank values):

```
sudo snap get novnc services.n6082
Key                    Value
services.n6082.listen  
services.n6082.vnc
```

### Integration and Deployment

or deploying the noVNC application in production environments:

* [Embedding](docs/EMBEDDING.md) - For the noVNC application
* [Library](docs/LIBRARY.md) - For the noVNC JavaScript library
